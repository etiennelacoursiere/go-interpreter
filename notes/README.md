This are my notes on the book "Writing an Interpreter in Go" by @Thorsten Ball. I'm trying to write this in my own word and how i understand it to help me solidify what i learn and also to have a fast summary to read when i come back to this.

If you want to learn more about this topic, you should read the book. It's really good.
